> For a technical explanation of how this plugin works, see the Shared module.

## Applying the plugin

Currently, this plugin requires the [Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-dsl-reference.html).
Otherwise, it does nothing.

Because this plugin only expose Kotlin/JS resources (other platforms' artifacts are automatically exposed by the Kotlin plugin), you will need to declare a JS target for this plugin to do anything.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
	kotlin("multiplatform") version "<add the version here>"
	id("dev.opensavvy.resources.consumer") version "<add the version here>"
}

kotlin {
	js {
		// …
	}
}
```

Currently, the plugin does not extract the resource dependencies automatically from your other dependencies: you should explicitly declare from which Maven coordinates you want to extract dependencies.

## Declare dependencies

For example, to extract resources from another project called `lib`:

```kotlin
kotlin {
	js {
		// …
	}

	sourceSets.jsMain.dependencies {
		// this is a regular code dependency
		implementation(project(":lib"))
	}
}

dependencies {
	// declare a dependency on the resources
	transitiveJsResources(project(":lib"))
}
```

To declare a dependency on an external library, use the same mechanism:

```kotlin
kotlin {
	js {
		// …
	}

	sourceSets.jsMain.dependencies {
		// this is a regular code dependency
		implementation("foo:bar:1.0")
	}
}

dependencies {
	// declare a dependency on the resources
	transitiveJsResources("foo:bar:1.0")
}
```

If you just want the resources but not the code, you can omit the `implementation` declaration.

## Accessing the resources

All resources from the dependencies are injected into the compilation phase as if they were present in `src/jsMain/resources/imported` directory.

Therefore, if you depend on a library which has a file `index.css`, you can access it as `imported/index.css`.
