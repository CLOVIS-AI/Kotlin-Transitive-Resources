> For a technical explanation of how this plugin works, see the Shared module.

## Configuration

Currently, this plugin requires the [Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-dsl-reference.html).
Otherwise, it does nothing.

Because this plugin only expose Kotlin/JS resources (other platforms' artifacts are automatically exposed by the Kotlin plugin), you will need to declare a JS target for this plugin to do anything.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
	kotlin("multiplatform") version "<add the version here>"
	id("dev.opensavvy.resources.producer") version "<add the version here>"
}

kotlin {
	js {
		// â€¦
	}
}
```

> **Important note.** Currently, the plugin only works if the JS target's source set has the default name (`jsMain`/`jsTest`).

That's all! Now, you can use the Consumer plugin in your other projects that are part of the same build.

If you want to publish your project to a Maven or Ivy repository, follow the normal instructions on how to publish a Kotlin Multiplatform library and the resources will automatically be added as a variant.
